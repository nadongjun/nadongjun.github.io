I'm Dongjun Na. I've been working as a blockchain developer at `Coinplug` since 2023. In 2023, I received my master's degree from Keimyung University, where my thesis focused on Network Scalability and Security.

I'm deeply interested in `computer network`, `cryptography` and the `development of blockchain peer-to-peer networks and smart contracts`. My aim is to utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the advancement of blockchain technology and its applications.
